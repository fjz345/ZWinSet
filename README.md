# ZWinSet
Tired of reinstalling all applications and set all 10 windows settings and remove bloat each time I reinstall windows.

## Usage
Follow instructions on screen, steps include:
* Select jobs to execute
* Confirm
* Wait until jobs are done

## Todo
* Dependencies (InstallChrome -> Set Chrome default)
* Better finish screen
* Progress bar somehow more accurate?
* All Installers
* All PowerShell scripts
